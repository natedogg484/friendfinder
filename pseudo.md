*Have not been able to get heroku to work*
I have an idea of where to go with my next step however I have tried something similar and it hasn't worked.

So, I cannot get my code to check through all of the available friends to make a match but I have most everything else working. 

If i could get that to work though, I would then have all of their friend index numbers compared and the friend with the lowest number would be the match (least difference in answers)

This friend's information would then be appeneded to the modal and the match would be made. There would also be a button on the modal to reset the while thing so that the 
user could try again and they could take the quiz again if they feel that their answers were unsatisfactory. I am very close to done which is sooo frustrating.

Also, I need to get help with heroku apparently for other projects it worked for me without a hitch so I don't know what I am missing right now.
